## IF YOU WANT TO RUN PROJECT FILE ON YOUR OWN - these are the instructions how to run the project:

1. First of all you need to open the project file on command prompt and run:

### `npm i`

2. Then, you need to host the project `OR` you need `OpenServer` (for `Windows` users) or `MAMP` (for `MACOS` users) application to run the server of `server.php`.

On OpenServer your project file should be located in `domians` folder. 
On MAMP it is `htdocs` folder.
